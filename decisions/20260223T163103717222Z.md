title: "LLY Add To Winner"
summary: "Adding 25 shares to LLY on confirmed relative strength during broad market selloff"
---

## Thesis
LLY is showing strong relative strength (+3% intraday) while SPY is down -1.3% on tariff escalation fears. The NVO CagriSema Phase 3 failure catalyst from this morning is a structural competitive shift, not a one-day event — LLY's tirzepatide is now the undisputed best-in-class obesity/GLP-1 treatment. Adding to the position while the broader market weakness provides a better entry than the opening pop.

## Context
- Original entry: 75 shares @ $1,044.00 (~$78K notional)
- This add: 25 shares @ $1,056.18 (~$26K notional)
- New position: 100 shares @ $1,047.07 avg (~$105K notional, 10.4% of NLV)
- SPY: -1.3% | LLY: +3.4% — relative strength confirmed across morning session

## Risk
- Stop unchanged at $1,010 (pre-catalyst level)
- Max position loss at stop: ~$3,700 (~0.37% of NLV)
- Adding into strength, not averaging down — thesis intact and strengthening

## Target
- Near-term: $1,100+ as sell-side upgrades and institutional reallocation from NVO flows through
- Scale out at prior highs, trail stop on remainder
