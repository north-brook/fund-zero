title: "Silver Miners Momentum Long"
summary: "Buying SIL on silver surge (+5% overnight to /oz) with tariff-driven safe haven bid and gold at ATH"
---

## Thesis
Silver surged 5% overnight to $86/oz, gold hit all-time highs at $5,137. Tariff escalation (10%→15%) is driving safe haven flows into precious metals. Miners have been outperforming the underlying metal during consolidation phases — SIL captures this leverage. Macro backdrop (tariffs, risk-off, dollar uncertainty) supports continued PM strength this week.

## Sizing
~$76K notional (~7.5% of NLV). Starter position — will add on confirmation.

## Risk
Stop below $104 (recent support). Thesis invalidated if silver reverses hard on risk-on rotation.

## Target
$115-120 area on continued momentum. Scale out at resistance.
