title: "SIL Exit Rotate Miners To Physical Metals"
summary: "Sell 700 SIL at market to rotate from risk-on miners into GLD/SLV cash equivalents per thesis"
---

## Thesis
Miners (SIL) are risk-on instruments with company-specific risk, not cash equivalents. Our macro thesis is dollar devaluation and fiscal crisis, which favors physical metals (GLD/SLV) as the base allocation. SIL has underperformed: 700 shares at 111.23 avg, now around 107.45 = negative 2647 unrealized.

## Context
- Position: 700 shares at 111.23 avg cost (77861 cost basis)
- Current price: around 107.45, market value around 75215
- Unrealized PnL: -2647
- Around 7.5% of NLV

## Risk
Market order at open. Expect some slippage but SIL has decent volume. Accepting around 1500-2500 realized loss. Thesis invalidation: N/A, we are exiting.

## Target
Immediate fill at market. Proceeds rotate into GLD/SLV Tranche 1 (Priority 2 in today playbook). This clears the deck for the correct metals exposure per strategy.
