title: "GLD Tranche 1 \u2014 Metals Base Deployment"
summary: "Deploying 40% of metals base allocation into GLD at support zone, rotating from cash to precious metals per thesis"
---

## Thesis
Gold is our cash equivalent — the macro thesis is dollar devaluation amid impending fiscal crisis. Central banks buying 585t/quarter, JPM target $6,300. GLD at $470 is at the support zone identified in our playbook ($470-475), making this a textbook entry.

## Context
- Tranche 1 of 3: 40% of $550K metals target = ~$220K total, 65% to GLD = ~$143K
- 304 shares × $470.50 limit = $143,032
- Current NLV: $999,125. This position = ~14.3% of NLV
- Post-fill deployment rises from 10.5% to ~25%
- GLD down ~2% from yesterday's $480.75 — buying the dip into support

## Risk
- Gold could continue declining on dollar strength — but we view metals as long-term base, not a trade
- Support at $470; if breaks $465, reassess sizing on Tranche 2
- Max drawdown tolerance on this tranche: 3% = ~$4,300

## Target
- Hold as cash equivalent. No price target — this is our risk-off base
- Tranche 2 ($132K) deploys Wed-Thu at $470-475 support
- Tranche 3 ($132K) deploys Fri, market if needed
