title: "SLV Tranche 1 Metals Base Allocation"
summary: "Buy 1028 SLV at 77.82 limit as first tranche of metals base per thesis"
---

## Thesis
Silver at 86+ with structural supply deficit and 120-125 Moz solar demand in 2026. SLV tracks physical silver — our cash equivalent alongside GLD. Dollar devaluation thesis demands metals as the base allocation.

## Context
- Tranche 1 of 3 (40% of target SLV allocation)
- Target: 80K notional in SLV (1028 shares at 77.82 limit)
- Total SLV target: 175-210K (35% of 500-600K metals base)
- Tranche 2 Wed/Thu at support levels (82-85), Tranche 3 Fri
- SLV flat at open (78.21) — playbook says buy immediately with limits when flat/down

## Risk
Limit order 0.5% below current price. If silver drops below support levels per thesis, reassess. No hard stop — structural position.

## Target
Hold indefinitely as cash equivalent alongside GLD. Will add Tranches 2 and 3 through the week to reach 175-210K in SLV.
