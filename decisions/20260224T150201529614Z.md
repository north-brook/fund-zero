title: "SLV Tranche 1 \u2014 Metals Base Deployment"
summary: "Deploying 40% of metals base allocation into SLV, complementing GLD for precious metals cash-equivalent position"
---

## Thesis
Silver is the second leg of our metals base. Supply deficit persists, solar demand 120-125 Moz in 2026. SLV gives direct metal exposure without the company-specific risk of miners (why we exited SIL). Silver at $78.21 is near our playbook entry zone.

## Context
- Tranche 1 of 3: 40% of $550K metals target = ~$220K total, 35% to SLV = ~$77K
- 985 shares × $78.25 limit = $77,026
- Combined with GLD order: ~$220K metals deployment (Tranche 1 complete)
- Current NLV: $999,125. This position = ~7.7% of NLV
- Post-fill (with GLD): deployment rises from 10.5% to ~32%

## Risk
- Silver more volatile than gold — can move 2-3% intraday
- Support at $75; if breaks, reassess Tranche 2 sizing
- Max drawdown tolerance on this tranche: 5% = ~$3,850

## Target
- Hold as cash equivalent alongside GLD
- Tranche 2 deploys Wed-Thu at $75-78 support
- Tranche 3 deploys Fri
