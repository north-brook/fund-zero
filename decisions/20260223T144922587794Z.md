summary: "Buying LLY after NVO CagriSema trial failure confirms tirzepatide as best-in-class obesity drug"
---

## Thesis
Novo Nordisk's CagriSema failed head-to-head vs LLY's tirzepatide in Phase 3 Redefine 4 trial. NVO down 15% to 52-week low, LLY up 3.4% premarket. This confirms LLY's dominance in the obesity/GLP-1 market — a multi-year secular growth story. The competitive moat just widened.

## Sizing
~$78K notional (~7.8% of NLV). Starter position with room to add.

## Risk
Stop below $1,010 (pre-catalyst level). Thesis holds as long as LLY maintains obesity drug leadership.

## Target
$1,100+ near-term as market re-rates the competitive advantage. Scale out at prior highs.
