title: "GLD Tranche 1 Metals Base Allocation"
summary: "Buy 320 GLD at 467.65 limit as first tranche of 500-600K metals base per thesis"
---

## Thesis
Dollar devaluation and fiscal crisis thesis demands precious metals as our cash equivalent. Gold at 5168 with central banks buying 585t/quarter, JPM target 6300. Tariff chaos and Iran risk sustain safe haven bid. GLD tracks physical gold directly — this is our risk-off base, not a trade.

## Context
- Tranche 1 of 3 (40% of target metals allocation)
- Target: 150K notional in GLD (320 shares at 467.65 limit)
- Total metals target: 500-600K across GLD (65%) and SLV (35%)
- Tranche 2 Wed/Thu at support levels (470-475), Tranche 3 Fri
- GLD flat at open (470.01) — playbook says buy immediately with limits when flat/down

## Risk
Limit order 0.5% below current price to catch an intraday pullback. If gold drops below 5000 (GLD below ~455), reassess entire metals base per thesis invalidation rules. No hard stop — this is a structural position, not a swing trade.

## Target
Hold indefinitely as cash equivalent. Not trading this for P&L — it is the base. Will add Tranches 2 and 3 through the week to reach 325-390K in GLD.
